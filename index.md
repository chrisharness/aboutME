*Let me tell you a bit about myself.*

## Who am I? ##

~~I am the greatest programmer alive~~
**I am a humble Computer Science student!!!**

## Ok, but who am I as a programmer? ##

For one, I am definitely not the greatest programmer, (yet)

I am a second-year transfer student at UCSD currently, so I am developing and honing my skills to hopefully one day become a Software Engineer. 

In terms of how we can get along...

```

while(YouAreHonestAndKind){
    we.maintainFriendship();
}

```
## Ok...But I still don't know who you are? ##

I'm glad you asked. *Some* of my hobbies include:

- Working Out
- Gaming
- Cooking for myself and family


### A subtle flex ###

**My favorite game at the moment is World of Warcraft**

These are my current world rankings for the class I play ( I play a tank, which carries tons of responsibility and leadership skills, as well as mechanical ability. This measurement is based on my percentile relation to the top performers of my class. As you can see, I'm pretty decent )
