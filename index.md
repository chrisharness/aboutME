*Let me tell you a bit about myself.*

## Who am I? ##

~~I am the greatest programmer alive~~
**I am a humble Computer Science student!!!**

## Ok, but who am I as a programmer? ##

For one, I am definitely not the greatest programmer, (yet)

I am a second-year transfer student at UCSD currently, so I am developing and honing my skills to hopefully one day become a Software Engineer. 

In terms of how we can get along...

```
while(YouAreHonestAndKind){
    we.maintainFriendship();
}

```
